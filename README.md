This is one of my internship task at Prodigy InfoTech. This code is a basic keylogger program written in python using pynput library.The program runs until terminated by pressing Ctrl+C. Then the log is saved to a keylog.txt file which can be viewed later. pynput library must be installed prior to running this code. Running this code might require administrator privileges.
